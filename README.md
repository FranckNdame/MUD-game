# version 0.1.0
=======================

Update:

*  The "command" function has been deleted due to it's lack of complexity and limited functionality. This function could only take one keyword at a time. It has therefore been replaced by the function "recommend". This is the first major update of this repository.

* The "recommend" function will take one argument  and equate it to "id". Based on the value of id, the "get-response" function will return various sets of responses.

* Despite being more advanced, this function still does not do much. The next versions will contain attempts to fixing this.
