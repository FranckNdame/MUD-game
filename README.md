# version 0.0.4
======================================

Update:

* Two functions "list-of-length" and "index-of-largest-number" have been added to the program.

    * List-of-length will accept a list of keywords from the "decisiontable" and will then match it to the given list of tokens from the user's input. This will result to a list of integers representing the matching magnitude of a the token list in relation to the keywords list.
    
    * Index-of-largest-number  will simply return the position of the largest number in the list. Note that the positions are assigned in a base notation 0 method.
    
* My git commits were also improved to proffesional standards
