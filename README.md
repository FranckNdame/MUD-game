# version 0.5.0
=======================

Update:


*	As the code becomes more and more complex, different sections were grouped together into different rkt files in order to facilitate navigation.

*	These various rkt files ('data.rkt', 'gui.rkt', 'location.rkt' and 'objects.rkt') were saved into a 'components' folder and imported to the 'main.rkt' files using the function 'include'.
